# WorkScheduler

## 

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this Work Scheduler.

- My motivation for this was to make a unique work scheduler that can save appointment names in my localStorage. 

- I built this scheduler mostly because I wanted a way to make an appointment scheduler that is saved, so that whenever I close and reopen my window, the appointment names will still be there. 

## Installation 
-N/A

## Usage 
* A. Click on an empty box to input your appointment name.
* B. Once appointment name is written, click on the save icon.
* C. Congrats! You will be alerted that the appointment is saved in localStorage. 
* D. When you refresh or exit in and out of the webpage, the saved items will persist.

## Legend 
* Blank white means you are outside of the 6 hour window for scheduling
* Gray is past 6 hours
* Green is next 6 hours
* Red is current hour
